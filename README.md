# Research Paper: Showrooming and Webrooming in Consumer Electronics Purchasing

## Overview

In the rapidly evolving landscape of consumer electronics purchasing, a new shopping paradigm has emerged, characterized by the interplay of **showrooming** and **webrooming** behaviours. 

- **Showrooming** refers to the practice of inspecting products in physical stores before purchasing them online.
- **Webrooming** involves researching products online before making the final purchase in a physical store.

This empirical research delves into the motivations behind these behaviours, focusing on critical factors such as **price comparison**, **in-store experience**, **trust**, **convenience**, and **demographic influences**. By employing a robust mixed-methods approach—including surveys, statistical analyses, in-depth interviews, and sentiment analysis—the study provides a comprehensive understanding of these behaviours within the electronics industry.

## Key Objectives

2. **Actionable Insights for Retailers**:
   - Provide actionable recommendations for electronics retailers to refine their strategies, enhance customer experiences, and adapt to evolving consumer preferences.
   - Highlight the importance of cultural nuances in shaping these behaviours.

3. **Future Research Directions**:
   - Suggest avenues for future exploration into other variables influencing consumer shopping behaviours in the digital age.
